This project was created during a 48h Game Jam weekened. The team members are:
- Kevin Da Cruz: Programmer
- Olliver Hopley: 3D/UI Technical Artist
- Paul Elder: 3D Artist

"A Long Commute" is a procedural arcade hopper about commuting through extreme circumstances! Along the way you'll need to collect muffins to fill up the muffinometre, as low blood sugar levels will result in the world losing its colour and becoming harder to traverse!
 
 Notable features:
- Procedural level generation with configurable set pieces, item spawning & difficulty progression.
- Happiness mechanic tied to muffins: low happiness levels will result in the average track piece baseline difficulty rising.
- High score saving


Dev notes:
- Kevin: Hope you enjoy this little game! It was fun to get stuck in and build the track & gameplay systems from the ground up, with the jam theme "Pushing Forwards" always at the centre of our minds. I'm quite pleased with the flexibility & scalability the track system has, as it allows for different biomes & unique set pieces with a progressive difficulty curve. Different biomes unfortunately didn't make it into the final submission, but I at least got to add in the difficulty stuff in a later patch. One of my proudest little wins this jam was getting the water/lava boats to "work". Death colliders were attached to either side of the boats to create the illusion that stepping into the water/lava would trigger a game over, meaning that I didn't have to program a system to detect what the player is actually standing on. In fact, all collidable elements in this game are treated as "Set Piece Items."
